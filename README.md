This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
# Need Backend running to make requests I.E login or signup or get any use of the application
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## A Sneak Peek Into the site...



## What Is MyMath?

This website is made to help anyone as well as everyone learn mathmatics at any lvl! this is possible with use of LLM technology as well as tracking your course that you have enrolled in! You can save profile information as well as enroll and unenroll courses you like and or dislike after enrolling. The course you enroll into can be used to tell myMath chat what you want to study and focus on!

## The Major Tecnologys used!
- Next Js
- React Js
- Tailwind CSS 
- Axios

Hosted On
- Vercel (Frontend)

## Practices used during development
- Agile
- Scrum
- Mockup Process

## Why these practices?

They really push you as a developer to get things done regardless of how you feel on some days! Some days I might be a little less productive, but having small obtainable goals in bursts really helps overall moral and development speed overall! Mockups allowed for a better development process in general as I had the entire scope of the website planned from the beginning as well as what technologys i'd implement. When ranking the difficulty of some inclusions of the application it helped me tame some expectations of speed, and allow a good overall product. Where as without agile and SCRUM practice I might be lost in a maze of problems without smaller bite sized chunks to make it easier to progress.
